## Current Focus
**Network Digital Twin & Observability**
- Building an open-source system (**Network Digital Twin**) for network monitoring and analytics
- Telemetry collection (e.g., sFlow), topology/flow monitoring, and performance evaluation
- System design with clear trade-offs (accuracy, overhead, scalability)

## Selected Projects


### Network Digital Twin
**Role:** core system design & implementation  
**Links:** 

**What:** An open-source system for network observability and analytics.  
**Why:** Operators need actionable visibility with low overhead and scalable collection.  
**How:** 
- Modular architecture: collector, monitor, controller, UI/website
- Efficient ingestion pipeline + per-flow/ per-link statistics
- Evaluations on (testbed / trace / emulation) showing overhead and accuracy
