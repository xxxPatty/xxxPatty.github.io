I am a Research Assistant at **Academia Sinica** working on **Network Digital Twin** systems.

Previously, I received my M.S. from **National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)** and my B.S. from **National Taiwan Ocean University (NTOU)**.

I enjoy building end-to-end systems: from architecture design to implementation and evaluation.
