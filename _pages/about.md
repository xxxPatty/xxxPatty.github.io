I am currently a Research Assistant at **Academia Sinica**, working under the supervision of Prof. Shie-Yuan Wang on Network Digital Twin systems and network observability.

Previously, I received my M.S. in Computer Science from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), where I was advised by Prof. Shie-Yuan Wang, and my B.S. from National Taiwan Ocean University (NTOU).

I enjoy building end-to-end systems: from architecture design to implementation and evaluation.

Outside of research, I am a disciplined long-distance runner and an aerial hoop practitioner. I also enjoy street dance training. Physical training helps me maintain focus and resilience in research.
